## High-Level Summary

We developed AgriSense, a comprehensive and interactive platform that integrates real-time data from our custom-built weather station with NASA's open datasets, Space Agency partner's data and predictive analytics. Our solution addresses the challenges of unpredictable weather, water scarcity, and inefficient resource management by providing farmers with actionable insights and data-driven strategies. By offering tools for water management, weather predictions, and impact assessments, live data visualization AgriSense empowers farmers to optimize their practices, enhance crop yields, and contribute to sustainable agriculture. This is vital for addressing food security and environmental challenges in a rapidly changing climate.

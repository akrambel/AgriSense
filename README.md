## High-Level Summary

We developed AgriSense, a comprehensive and interactive platform that integrates real-time data from our custom-built weather station with NASA's open datasets, Space Agency partner's data and predictive analytics. Our solution addresses the challenges of unpredictable weather, water scarcity, and inefficient resource management by providing farmers with actionable insights and data-driven strategies. By offering tools for water management, weather predictions, and impact assessments, live data visualization AgriSense empowers farmers to optimize their practices, enhance crop yields, and contribute to sustainable agriculture. This is vital for addressing food security and environmental challenges in a rapidly changing climate.

## Project Details

## What exactly does it do?
AgriSense collects real-time data on key environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, heat index, soil moisture, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, and more. It generates predictive charts and weather forecasts for up to a whole month, helping farmers make informed decisions about irrigation, planting schedules, and pest control. 

It offers Water Management Strategies, Weather Predictions, Impact Assessments, and Live Data Visualization through a user-friendly interface, allowing farmers to monitor and analyze the health of their fields in real-time. The intuitive design ensures that farmers can easily navigate the platform and access the critical information they need for decision-making.



- Water Management Solution Summary:

Our Water Management Solution optimizes irrigation by utilizing real-time data from custom-built weather stations and predictive analytics. It provides actionable insights on irrigation timing and quantity, reducing water wastage and enhancing crop yields. The solution includes soil moisture prediction charts and water management charts that visualize changes and optimal schedules, helping farmers anticipate needs. Tailored recommendations for various plant types ensure efficient water use, promoting sustainable farming practices.
